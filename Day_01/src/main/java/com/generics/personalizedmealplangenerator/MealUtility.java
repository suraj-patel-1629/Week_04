/*4. Personalized Meal Plan Generator
Concepts: Generic Methods, Type Parameters, Bounded Type Parameters
Problem Statement:
Design a Personalized Meal Plan Generator where users can choose different meal categories like Vegetarian, Vegan, Keto, or High-Protein. The system should ensure only valid meal plans are generated.
Hints:
Define an interface MealPlan with subtypes (VegetarianMeal, VeganMeal, etc.).
Implement a generic class Meal<T extends MealPlan> to handle different meal plans.
Use a generic method to validate and generate a personalized meal plan dynamically.*/
package com.generics.personalizedmealplangenerator;

// Utility class for meal validation
class MealUtility {
    // Generic method to generate a meal plan
    public static <T extends MealPlan> void generateMeal(T meal) {
        System.out.println("Generated Meal: " + meal.getMealName());
        meal.displayMeal();
    }
}
